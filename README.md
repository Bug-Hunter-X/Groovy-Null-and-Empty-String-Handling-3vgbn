# Groovy Null and Empty String Handling

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Groovy when handling null and empty strings, and provides a robust solution.

The `bug.groovy` file contains code that exhibits unexpected behavior, while `bugSolution.groovy` shows an improved way to check for null or empty strings.

This is a concise illustration of a subtle but important Groovy programming practice.
